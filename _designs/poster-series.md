# Project Overview

This poster series was designed to visually capture the mood and rhythm of Drift Fest’s latest album tour. Each piece blends abstract visuals with energetic typography to reflect the band’s unique fusion of ambient and electronic styles. The goal was to create high-impact promotional materials that would resonate with fans and stand out in both print and digital formats.

## Tools & Techniques

- Adobe Photoshop for photo manipulation, overlays, and lighting effects  
- Adobe InDesign for layout composition and print-ready formatting  
- Custom textures and gradients to convey movement and sound visually

### Outcomes

The final poster set included designs for three major tour stops, each using a different color theme tied to the mood of that show’s setlist. This project pushed my creative experimentation with type and layering, and strengthened my ability to tell a story visually through print media. Posters were printed at 18x24" and used across both social platforms and event spaces.
