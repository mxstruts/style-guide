# Project Overview

The Buster’s Best Brand Identity was developed to position the company as a trustworthy and health-conscious provider of dry dog food. The design emphasizes warmth, friendliness, and care—appealing to both pet owners and their furry companions. A combination of playful typography, natural textures, and earth-toned colors creates a visual language that reflects quality and love for dogs.

## Tools & Techniques

- Adobe Illustrator for logo design, icons, and packaging elements  
- Adobe Photoshop for product mockups and texture effects 

### Outcomes

This project allowed me to explore how design can build trust and emotional connection with pet owners. The final deliverables included a custom logo, packaging design for various dog breeds and food types, and a digital brand kit for social media and web use. The branding was presented with a clean, earthy aesthetic to reflect the natural ingredients and care behind the product.
