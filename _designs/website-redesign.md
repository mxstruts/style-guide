# Project Overview

This website redesign project focused on elevating a personal portfolio to better highlight design and development work in a professional, user-friendly way. The goal was to create a responsive layout that balances aesthetics with functionality, making it easy for visitors to explore projects, read case studies, and contact the creator.

## Tools & Techniques

- Figma for wireframes, prototypes, and style guide creation

### Outcomes

The redesigned site features a minimalist, grid-based layout with smooth navigation, clear project sections, and integrated contact functionality. This project helped refine my UI/UX thinking, strengthened my front-end coding skills, and gave me the opportunity to build a design system that can grow with future portfolio updates.
